# ghostnote-community-scripts

These scripts are public domain, donated by me to the Ghostnote community. Feel free to contribute and submit pull requests!

To find out more about Ghostnote, visit the [Ghostnote website][].

## How to use:

1. Open Ghostnote.
2. Click the settings gear to show the menu.
3. Choose Scripts, then choose "View Application Scripts Folder".
4. Copy the scripts in this repo under the applescript folder into the folder opened in the previous step.
5. You are now using the bleeding edge document retrieval strategies for Ghostnote.

> **Note:** If you made changes to the scripts in the Applcation Scripts folder previously, the steps above would overwrite them. Also, if you choose install document support from the Ghostnote settings menu, it will overwrite with the versions that were included in the last release, and may not be the latest.


## How can I add support for an app?

Ghostnote looks for scripts that are named after the bundle ID of the application they run for. For example Safari uses "com.apple.Safari". These names are case sensitive, and much be an exact match.

So to add support for an app "Foo" you must find its bundle ID. A script elsewhere in this repo is provided that will display the bundle ID for a selected app.

If youâ€™re Terminal-savvy, you can get the bundle ID of any app with the following command:

```
mdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -r /Applications/Your\ App.app
```

If the bundle ID of Foo is `com.bar.Foo` then the script should be named `com.bar.Foo.scpt`.

> **Note:** The current version of Ghostnote uses `.scpt` as the script extension, but this was a mistake, as the included scripts are acutally plain text and should use the extension `.applescript`. Scripts using the `.scpt` extension will be migrated to `.applescript` in Ghostnote 1.2.

Now that you have an empty script named correctly, you must implement the strategy. How to do this varies by the app and their support for scripting. Some apps have excellent scripting support, such as MS Office apps, while others have none.

We hope for Foo to have an AppleScript dictionary. Having a dictionary means Foo supports some level of scripting natively.


## How to customize scripts ?

Choose the script you want to customize and open it in your favorite editor. (I prefer AppleScript editor.) You can do anything inside the script, but make sure the implicit run handler returns a (hopefully correct) document name.
